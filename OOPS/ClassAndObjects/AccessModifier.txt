Access Modifier 
- Access Modifier defines the scope/visibility of a class (Variables, constructor and methods)

Types of Access modifier :
1. Public :
- public is an access modifier in Java that makes classes, methods, or variables accessible from anywhere in the program — both inside and outside the package.

2. Private :
- private is the most restrictive access modifier in Java.
When you declare a variable, method, or constructor as private, it can be accessed only within the same class — not from any other class (even in the same package).

🔹 1️⃣ Why outer classes can’t be private
A top-level class must be accessible by the Java runtime and possibly other classes —
so if you made it private, no other class (not even the main method) could access it.
That’s why Java does not allow top-level classes to be private.

3. Protected :
The protected access modifier in Java allows a variable, method, or constructor to be accessed:
within the same package, and
in subclasses (child classes) even if they are in different packages.
So, protected is like a bridge between default and public —
it’s more open than default, but not fully open like public.

4. Default :
If no access modifier (like public, private, or protected) is explicitly specified,
then Java automatically applies the default access modifier.
So, “default” is not a keyword — it’s just the absence of any modifier.
